0,"BASKING RIDGE, N.J., Nov. 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- electroCore, Inc. (Nasdaq: ECOR), a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company, today announced third quarter 2019 financial results and provided an operational update. 
 “I accepted the CEO role at electroCore because I firmly believe in the potential of the company’s novel non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation technology to treat serious headache conditions,” said Dan Goldberger, Chief Executive Officer of electroCore. “With FDA-cleared indications for acute treatment of the pain associated with each of migraine and episodic cluster headache, and cluster headache prevention, we have the ability to address significant commercial and government market opportunities that have gone largely untapped to this point. We have a novel, proprietary technology and very large addressable markets, and I, together with the rest of the electroCore team, look forward to unlocking the potential of gammaCore for the benefit of patients as well as our shareholders.” 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2019, electroCore reported net sales of approximately $683,000, compared to $151,000 in the third quarter of 2018. Net sales were $623,000 in the second quarter and $410,000 in the first quarter of 2019. These increases in revenue reflect increased sales in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
 Total operating expenses for third quarter of 2019 were approximately $11.2 million, compared to $13.6 million in the third quarter of 2018. The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in SG&A expense, which declined to approximately $8.1 million in the third quarter of 2019 from approximately $11.3 million for the comparable period in 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in compensation and other expenses consistent with the cost reduction plan implemented in June 2019. The third quarter of 2019 included restructuring and other severance related costs of $0.8 million. 
 GAAP net loss from operations for the third quarter of 2019 was $10.7 million as compared to a loss of $13.2 million in the third quarter of 2018. 
 Adjusted EBITDA net loss from operations for the third quarter of 2019 was a loss of $8.4 million, a 34% decrease when compared to adjusted EBITDA net loss from operations of $12.7 million for the same period last year. 
 The Company defines adjusted EBITDA net loss from operations as GAAP net loss from operations, excluding income tax expense, stock-compensation expense, restructuring and other severance related charges, legal fees associated with stockholders litigation and total other income /expense. A reconciliation of GAAP net loss from operations to Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA net loss from operations has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. 
 Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2019 totaled approximately $33.5 million, as compared to approximately $68.6 million at December 31, 2018. Net cash usage for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 was approximately $7.6 million, which included cash outflows of approximately $0.8 million related to severance payments and CEO recruitment costs. By comparison, net cash usage was $11.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $16.2 million in the first quarter of 2019. 
 As previously disclosed, based on its current cash resources, and revenue and expense forecasts, electroCore believes that it will have adequate resources to fund its operations into the beginning of 2021. 
 An archived webcast of the event will be available on the “Investors” section of the Company’s website at: www.electrocore.com.

 *On June 21, 2018, the Company converted from a limited liability company to a corporation and conducted its initial public offering (“IPO”). This conversion changed the relative ownership of the Company, such that retroactive application of the conversion periods prior to IPO for the purposes of calculating earnings (loss) per share would not be meaningful. 
 The Company has presented adjusted EBITDA net loss from operations as a non-GAAP financial measure in this press release. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA net loss from operations as its reported GAAP net loss from operations excluding income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other severance related charges, legal fees associated with stockholders litigation and total other income /expense and other income and expense. 
 The Company’s use of a non-GAAP measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of its results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 the non-GAAP measure does not reflect interest or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available; 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and the non-GAAP measure does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
 the non-GAAP measure does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; 
 other companies, including companies in electroCore’s industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA net loss from operations differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 Because of these and other limitations, you should consider the non-GAAP measure together with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and other GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP net loss from operations to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA net loss from operations has been provided in the preceding financial statement table of this press release.",2019-11-13T00:00:00.000Z,electroCore Announces Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results
1,"LYON, France & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov 27, 2018--The Medicrea Group (Euronext Growth Paris: FR0004178572- ALMED ; OTCQX Best Market – MRNTY & MRNTF), pioneering the transformation of spinal surgery through Artificial Intelligence, predictive modeling and patient specific implants with its UNiD™ ASI (Adaptive Spine Intelligence) proprietary software platform, services and technologies, today announced the closing of a $30 million senior secured notes issue by Medicrea and wholly subscribed by Perceptive Advisors, a leading multi-strategy healthcare investment firm. In conjunction with the senior secured notes, Medicrea has issued to Perceptive Advisors warrants for the Company’s new ordinary shares. 
 Denys Sournac, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, states “We are glad to execute this financing with Perceptive Advisors. The new secured notes will give us the necessary capital to continue to fuel our UNiD™ ASI growth strategy in the United States and will give us the required funds to continue the development of other proprietary products. We look forward to working with Perceptive, one of the leading healthcare focused investment firms in the world. We believe this refinancing is another validation of our proprietary, patient specific technology focused on restoring sagittal and coronal alignment.” 
 Sam Chawla, Portfolio Manager at Perceptive Advisors states, “We are excited about this investment in Medicrea. This refinancing retires most of the Company’s existing debt, and gives the company the financial flexibility to accelerate UNID™ ASI adoption. The company has a unique service and product offering in the Spine market and has delivered superior patient outcomes. With a clean capitalization, simplified balance sheet, and excess cash, Medicrea has a significant opportunity to grow over the coming years.” 
 The refinancing facility will consist of $30 million senior secured and guaranteed notes, governed by New-York law with coupon based on the greater of Three-Month LIBOR or 2.5% plus a margin of 8.5%. The notes will be issued at par value on the 27 th of November 2018, the expected date for the settlement and delivery, and will mature on the 27 th of November 2022. The notes will be guaranteed by Medicrea USA Corp, a 100 % fully owned subsidiary of Medicrea and will be secured by pledges on certain assets and receivables of the Group. 
 This refinancing will help Medicrea fund its UNiD ASI growth strategy in the United States as well as continue to focus on new product development. Five years after its initial launch in September 2013, over 3,000 patients have benefited from UNiD™ ASI 100% proprietary pre-operative planning technologies and services associated with patient-specific spinal realignment rods. UNiD products have seen a strong acceleration in adoption rate in 2018 especially in the USA (+62% cases year-to-date 2018 and +90% in Q3 2018). 
 Medicrea has also retired all of its outstanding €15 million convertible debt with Athyrium Capital Management and will use the proceeds to pay down portions of other secured outstanding debt for a total amount of €1.55 million. 
 Medicrea believes this refinancing (excluding the exercise of the warrants) should support the development of the Company until it reaches operational profitability. 
 Perceptive Credit Holdings II,LP subscribed to 1,000,000 warrants. The settlement and delivery of the warrants should take place on the 27 th of November, 2018. These warrants will not be subject to a request for admission to trading on the Euronext Growth market in Paris and will therefore not be listed. 
 One warrant entitles its holder to subscribe to one new Medicrea International ordinary share, at an exercise price of € 2.19, corresponding to the volume-weighted average of the share prices of the last 10 trading days prior to the fixing of the subscription price, decreased by a 10 % discount pursuant to the 14 th resolution of the General Meeting of May 17, 2018. The warrants will be exercisable for a period of seven years after their issuance. 
 The new shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants will carry current dividend rights and will be tradable on Euronext Growth and will be listed on the same line as the existing shares (ISIN : FR0004178572). 
 The shares that would be issued in the event of the exercise of all the warrants represent 4.93% of the Company’s share capital as of today (on a fully diluted basis). 
 For illustrative purposes, the interest of a shareholder holding 1% of the share capital of Medicrea would be brought to 0.94% if all the warrants were to be exercised. 
 Furthermore, the table below presents the potential cumulative dilution in the event that all outstanding warrants, options, and other securities that have the potential to be converted into ordinary shares are exercised (including all the warrants issued since 2017, the stocks options and the potential free allocations of shares): 
 To the Company’s knowledge, the distribution of the shareholders holding more than 5% of the share capital of the Company on a non-diluted basis before and after the exercise of the warrants is as follows: 
 Using the delegation of powers granted by the General Meeting of May 17, 2018, pursuant to the 14 th resolution, the Board of Directors decided on November 26, 2018 the issuance of 1,000,000 warrants in favor of a category of investors as defined in the 14 th resolution of the said meeting in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code, i.e. funds and/or investment companies with an international dimension (i. e.: carrying out financial operations in several countries), operating in the field of health and/or medical devices and each of which would participate in the operation for an amount at least equal to €100,000 or the equivalent of this amount in foreign currency (in accordance with the provisions of Article 211-2 3° of the General Regulations of French Autorité des Marchés Financiers). 
 It should be specified that none of the current shareholders or officers of Medicrea International are among the beneficiaries of the operation.

3,"Motus GI Holdings, Inc., (NASDAQ: MOTS) (“Motus GI” or the “Company”), a medical technology company providing endoscopy solutions that improve clinical outcomes and enhance the cost-efficiency associated with the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal conditions, today announced that it has entered into a $8.0 million secured term loan with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the bank of the world’s most innovative companies and their investors. The term loan further bolsters the Company’s balance sheet and will be used to help finance the recently launched U.S. commercialization of the Pure-Vu® System and for general corporate purposes. 
 “Securing this non-dilutive term loan with SVB is the beginning of an important new financing relationship with a well-respected bank with whom we can partner as the Company continues to grow. This infusion of low-cost capital provides Motus GI with additional resources to support the commercialization of the Pure-Vu System, which launched sales to U.S. hospitals this fall,” commented Tim Moran, Chief Executive Officer of Motus GI. “The U.S. hospital inpatient colonoscopy market is substantial, comprised of approximately 1.5 million annual procedures, many of which can be delayed or cancelled due to insufficient bowel prep. We believe the Pure-Vu System can reduce the costs associated with critical procedures that are often delayed or repeated and lead to extended, resource-intensive hospital stays.” 
 “Motus GI has developed a unique and innovative solution that provides both clinical and economic benefits to hospitals when performing inpatient colonoscopies. We are pleased to partner with the leadership team at Motus GI and provide this debt facility to help support bringing the Pure-Vu System to patients, gastroenterologists and hospitals across the U.S.,” said Clark Hayes, Head of Northeast Business Development and Southeast Life Science team, Scott McCarty, Director and Laura Scott, Market Manager at Silicon Valley Bank. 
 The term loan was funded on December 13, 2019. The term loan requires monthly interest-only payments through December 31, 2021, followed by monthly payments of principal and interest until December 1, 2023. Interest on the term loan accrues at a floating per annum rate of the greater of (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus 0.5% or (ii) 5.5%. Other material terms related to the term loan can be found in the Company’s 8K, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Motus GI Holdings, Inc. is a medical technology company, with subsidiaries in the U.S. and Israel, providing endoscopy solutions that improve clinical outcomes and enhance the cost-efficiency associated with the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal conditions. The Company’s flagship product is the Pure-Vu® System, a U.S. FDA cleared medical device indicated to help facilitate the cleaning of a poorly prepared colon during the colonoscopy procedure. The device integrates with standard and slim colonoscopes to enable safe and rapid cleansing during the procedure while preserving established procedural workflow and techniques. Challenges with bowel preparation for inpatient colonoscopy represent a significant area of unmet need that directly affects clinical outcomes and increases the cost of care in a market segment that comprises approximately 1.5 million annual procedures in the U.S. and approximately 4 million annual procedures worldwide. Motus GI believes the Pure-Vu® System may improve outcomes and lower costs for hospitals by reducing the time to successful colonoscopy, minimizing delayed and incomplete procedures, and improving the quality of an exam. In clinical studies to date, the Pure-Vu® System significantly increased the number of patients with an adequate cleansing level, according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale Score, a validated assessment instrument.

9,"KFAR-SABA, Israel & ALISO VIEJO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb 4, 2019--CathWorks announced the completion of a $30 million Series C financing round led by Deerfield Management. 
 Jim Corbett, CathWorks CEO, stated, “We are delighted to have such a notable investor leading this round and for the continued full participation of our existing syndicate of investors. Our company was fortunate to have tremendous excitement around the CathWorks FFR angio™ System following release of the FAST-FFR clinical study results. This funding, coupled with our recent FDA 510(k) clearance, paves the way for acceleration of our clinical and commercial activities in the United States.” 
 Deerfield Management Principal, Andrew ElBardissi, MD, added, “The CathWorks FFR angio platform technology has the potential to become standard of care in PCI [percutaneous coronary intervention] and other interventions where physiologic assessment is critical to determining which patients would benefit from revascularization. We believe there is tremendous clinical and economic potential for all stakeholders, including clinicians, patients and payors.” 
 The CathWorks System received United States Food & Drug Administration 510(k) clearance on December 19, 2018. The predicate used for demonstrating substantial equivalence was conventional invasive FFR as demonstrated during the FAST-FFR clinical study. 
 The CathWorks FFR angio System quickly and precisely delivers the objective FFR guidance needed to optimize PCI therapy decisions for every patient across the full coronary tree. It is non-invasive and performed intra-procedurally during coronary angiography without adding additional clinical risk or per-procedure costs. 
 CathWorks co-founder Guy Lavi commented, “We are excited for the investment to support FFR angio market entry and continue with technical and clinical acceleration. As always, we want to thank our clinical development partners in Israel, the United States, and Europe for enabling us to reach this exciting milestone.” 
 CathWorks is a medical technology company focused on applying its advanced computational science platform to optimize PCI therapy decisions and elevate coronary angiography from visual assessment to an objective FFR-based decision-making tool for physicians. FFR-guided PCI decision-making is proven to provide significant clinical benefits for patients with coronary artery disease and economic benefits for patients and payers. The company’s focus is specifically on bringing the CathWorks FFR angio System to market to provide quick, precise, and objective intraprocedural FFR guidance that is practical for every case.

 In the interest of transparency, we quantify our IBKR PRO clients’ all-in cost of trade execution below. 
 For the full multimedia release with graph see link: 
 The above illustrates that the rolling twelve months’ average all-in cost of an IBKR PRO client U.S. Reg.-NMS stock trade was 1.7 basis points. 
 Note 1: Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs) – customer orders divided by the number of trading days in the period. 
 Note 2: FDIC insured client bank deposit sweep program balances with participating banks. These deposits are not reported in the Company’s statement of financial condition. 
 Note 3: Commissionable Order – a customer order that generates commissions. 
 Note 4: In connection with our currency diversification strategy, we have determined to base our net worth in GLOBALs, a basket of 14 major currencies in which we hold our equity. The total effect of the currency diversification strategy is reported in Comprehensive Income; the components are reported in (1) Other Income in the corporate segment and (2) Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) on the balance sheet. The effect of the GLOBAL on our comprehensive income can be estimated by multiplying the total equity for the period by the change in the U.S. dollar value of the GLOBAL during the same period. 
 Note 5: Mark to market gains and losses on investments in U.S. government securities and associated hedges are included in Other Income. In the general course of business, we hold these investments to maturity. As a result, accumulated mark to market gains or losses should converge to zero at maturity. Accounting conventions require broker-dealers, unlike banks, to mark all investments to market. 
 Note 6: Trade money is the total amount of money clients spent or received, including all commissions and fees. 
 Note 7: Consistent with the clients’ trading activity, the computed VWAP benchmark includes extended trading hours.

19,"ROCHESTER, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 16, 2018--OneStream Software, LLC, a leader in Corporate Performance Management (CPM) solutions for the mid-sized to large enterprise, announced several new solutions for its XF MarketPlace during its annual Splash User Conference and Partner Summit, which opened today with over 700 attendees. 
 OneStream XF MarketPlace solutions can be downloaded by customers, configured and deployed quickly to address specific business requirements. The latest additions to the XF MarketPlace include a solution that automates and simplifies corporate tax provisioning and a lease accounting solution that helps businesses comply with upcoming new guidelines under IFRS 16 and ASC 842. Additionally, OneStream has added three new productivity tools, and an enhanced version of its Account Reconciliations solution. 
 “Our XF MarketPlace is all about enabling our customers to extend the value of their investment in our platform and address key business challenges in planning, reporting and compliance such as People Planning, Capital Planning, Account Reconciliations, and now Tax Provisioning and Lease Accounting. We’ve delivered more than 40 solutions to date and continue to add new solutions based on the needs of our customers,” said Tom Shea, CEO of OneStream. 
 Given recent, and ongoing changes in tax laws, tax provisioning solutions are a priority for many organizations who currently struggle with spreadsheets and other point solutions. The new solution automates the tax provisioning process, reducing risk and improving efficiency for finance professionals. This solution is a natural extension of the global financial consolidation and reporting capabilities of the OneStream XF platform, and leverages key capabilities such as book trial balance, supplemental data collection, currency translation, complex calculations and consolidations across multiple entity hierarchies. Early adopter customers are seeing immediate benefits. 
 With new lease accounting standards IFRS 16 and ASC 842 going into effect in about six months, many businesses are seeking solutions that consolidate lease contract data and simplify the accounting and reporting process. The new OneStream XF MarketPlace solution supports collection of lease contract data in a central database, calculation of balance sheet and income statement adjustments as well as generation of journal entries executed either in OneStream XF or the General Ledger. Several customers are already streamlining lease accounting with the new solution. 
 “Using OneStream’s Tax Provisioning solution has been a big improvement over the spreadsheet approach we were using before,” said Jennifer Koorie, Corporate Tax Manager at Victaulic. “For example, with OneStream we were able to efficiently consolidate our tax footnotes and financial statement disclosures, eliminating the previously manual process.” 
 “We find that the tax provision and reporting process is getting greater attention from CFOs and audit committees. The need for greater transparency to support disclosures and a desire to shorten the accounting close are two main reasons, especially with changing tax codes. Companies that currently use spreadsheets for tax provision should consider replacing them with a dedicated application,” said Robert Kugel, Senior Vice President and Research Director at Ventana Research. “Companies that want to accelerate their close, reduce the chance of errors, simplify audit defense and increase internal transparency should consider OneStream to integrate tax processes with their financial consolidation.” 
 “We have three IFRS 16 lease accounting projects underway with OneStream customers, with more expected,” said Pascal Walk, Partner, Agium EPM. “The relational blending capability of OneStream makes it the perfect platform for capturing detailed information from lease contracts, then making calculations and analyzing the impact of the impending lease accounting guidelines on current and future financial statements.” 
 OneStream Software provides a leading Corporate Performance Management (CPM) solution that unifies and simplifies financial consolidation, planning, reporting, analytics and financial data quality for sophisticated organizations. Deployed in the cloud or on-premise, OneStream XF is the first and only solution that delivers corporate standards and controls, with the flexibility for business units to report and plan at additional levels of detail without impacting corporate standards – all through a single application. 
 The OneStream XF MarketPlace features downloadable solutions that allow customers to easily extend the value of their CPM platform to quickly meet the changing needs of finance and operations.

23,"ALACHUA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug 2, 2018--RTI Surgical, Inc. (Nasdaq: RTIX), a global surgical implant company, reported operating results for the second quarter of 2018. 
 “Our team is sustaining the momentum generated over the past 18 months, as evidenced by our positive operational and financial performance this quarter,” said Camille Farhat, chief executive officer. “As anticipated in our previously issued guidance, our OEM franchise continues to contribute attractive growth, which we believe demonstrates the importance of the changes we implemented in 2017 and the value of our diverse portfolio. Our current operational excellence priorities, focused primarily on the cost of tissue processing, began to positively impact our cost of sales this quarter, providing significant margin and adjusted EBITDA improvements. Our efforts to date are encouraging and we believe that we remain well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2018 and beyond.” 
 Farhat added, “As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to make significant strides in our strategic transformation. Following the recent owned agency transition announcement, we have further reduced the complexity of our operations through the reduction of vertical integration and increased focus on our strength in tissue processing. We believe we maintain strong partnerships with the organ procurement community that, in our opinion, ensure that we can continue to expand the number of patients served with our differentiated allograft products. With the implementation of our operational excellence initiatives well underway, we are starting to see the positive outcomes in our financial results, and I am proud of the ongoing efforts of many people across the Company. Also, we are encouraged by the progress demonstrated by the team managing the Zyga acquisition and integration, which exemplify our endeavors to accelerate growth. In light of this progress, I am focused on reinvigorating the R&D pipeline and pursuing attractive deals at logical valuations.” 
 RTI’s worldwide revenues for the second quarter of 2018 were $70.7 million, down slightly compared with $72.1 million during the same period for the prior year. Excluding a $3.7 million reduction from the sale of substantially all the assets of the cardiothoracic closure business completed in August 2017, our total revenues increased $2.2 million, or 3.3%. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2018 was $30.0 million, inclusive of a $6.8 million charge for the write-off of excess inventory related to decreased distributions of our map3® implant and the purchase accounting step-up of Zyga inventory. To partially offset the impact of the decreased distribution of map3® implant we signed a distribution agreement with Aziyo Biologics, Inc., to supplement our biologics portfolio with an alternative allograft stem cell product. Excluding the excess inventory charge and purchase accounting impact, our Adjusted Gross Profit for the second quarter of 2018 was $36.8 million or 52.1% of revenues, compared to $37.0 million, or 51.3% of revenues, in the second quarter of 2017. 
 During the second quarter of 2018, RTI incurred non-recurring pre-tax charges to support the ongoing strategic transformation of the business. The company incurred $4.5 million in asset impairment and abandonment charges related to decreased distribution of our map3® implant During the second quarter of 2017, the company incurred $3.4 million of non-recurring pre-tax charges. 
 Net loss applicable to common shares was $6.4 million, or $0.10 per fully diluted common share in the second quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss applicable to common shares of $2.6 million, or $0.04 per fully diluted common share in the second quarter of 2017. As outlined in the reconciliation tables that follow, excluding the impact of the various non-recurring charges, Adjusted Net Income applicable to common shares was $2.0 million, or $0.03 per fully diluted common share in the second quarter of 2018. 
 Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), for the second quarter of 2018 was $9.1 million, or 13% of revenues compared with $8.3 million, inclusive of $1.2 million of EBITDA related to the cardiovascular closure business, or 11% of revenues for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by the reduction in operating expenses associated with efforts to reduce complexity and increase operational excellence implemented during 2017. 
 Based on our recent financial results and current business outlook, the Company is reiterating financial guidance for 2018, originally issued on January 5, 2018: The Company expects full year revenues in the range of $280 million and $290 million. The Company expects full year Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $32 million to $38 million. 
 The Company noted the following assumptions are included in its guidance: Relatively stable market conditions and regulatory environment; Positive revenue contribution from the acquisition of Zyga Technology – announced January 4, 2018; Ongoing positive impact of efforts to reduce complexity and implement operational excellence; and Continued demand of map3® cellular allogeneic bone graft or alternative allograft stem cell product.

 AVITA Medical is a regenerative medicine company with a technology platform positioned to address unmet medical needs in burns, chronic wounds, and aesthetics indications. AVITA Medical’s patented and proprietary collection and application technology provides innovative treatment solutions derived from the regenerative properties of a patient’s own skin. The medical devices work by preparing REGENERATIVE EPIDERMAL SUSPENSION™ (RES™), an autologous suspension comprised of the patient’s skin cells necessary to regenerate natural healthy epidermis. This autologous suspension is then sprayed onto the areas of the patient requiring treatment. 
 AVITA Medical’s first U.S. product, the RECELL ® System, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2018. The RECELL System is indicated for use in the treatment of acute thermal burns in patients 18 years and older. The RECELL System is used to prepare Spray-On Skin™ Cells using a small amount of a patient’s own skin, providing a new way to treat severe burns, while significantly reducing the amount of donor skin required. The RECELL System is designed to be used at the point of care alone or in combination with autografts depending on the depth of the burn injury. Compelling data from randomized, controlled clinical trials conducted at major U.S. Burn Centers and real-world use in more than 8,000 patients globally, reinforce that the RECELL System is a significant advancement over the current standard of care for burn patients and offers benefits in clinical outcomes and cost savings. Healthcare professionals should read the INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE - RECELL ® Autologous Cell Harvesting Device ( https://recellsystem.com/ ) for a full description of indications for use and important safety information including contraindications, warnings and precautions. 
 In international markets, our products are marketed under the RECELL System brand to promote skin healing in a wide range of applications including burns, chronic wounds and aesthetics. The RECELL System is TGA-registered in Australia and received CE-mark approval in Europe.

25,"RESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun 12, 2018--Science Applications International Corporation (NYSE: SAIC), a leading technology integrator providing full life-cycle services and solutions in the technical, engineering, intelligence, and enterprise information technology markets, today announced results for the first quarter ended May 4, 2018. 
 “Solid execution in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 resulted in SAIC’s third consecutive quarter of revenue growth and strong cash flow generation,” said SAIC CEO Tony Moraco. “Continued momentum enabled by the execution of our strategy against an improving federal budget environment allows us to invest for the future in both innovative technologies and new business opportunities.” 
 Revenues for the quarter increased $72 million, or 6.5%, compared to the prior year quarter due to revenue on new contracts primarily supporting NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ($47 million) and increased orders in our supply chain portfolio ($64 million). These increases were partially offset by completion of contracts and other net decreases across our portfolio ($39 million). 
 Operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 5.6%, compared to 5.7% for the prior year quarter, driven by higher supply chain material content which generate lower operating margins. 
 Net income for the quarter remained consistent as compared to the same period in the prior year. Higher operating income was offset by a lower tax deduction from stock-based compensation in the current quarter. 
 EBITDA (1) as a percentage of revenues for the quarter decreased to 6.5%, compared to 6.6% for the prior year quarter, driven by higher supply chain material content which generate lower operating margins. 
 Diluted earnings per share was $1.13 for the quarter. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter was 43.4 million shares. 
 Total cash flows provided by operating activities for the first quarter were $88 million, consistent with the same period in the prior year. A net increase in working capital investments in platform integration programs supporting the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps was offset by strong customer collections in the current quarter. 
 During the quarter SAIC deployed $54 million of capital, consisting of $32 million in plan share repurchases (412 thousand shares) under SAIC’s previously announced share repurchase program, $14 million in cash dividends and an $8 million term loan repayment. 
 Subsequent to quarter-end, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.31 per share of the Company’s common stock payable on July 27, 2018 to stockholders of record on July 13, 2018. SAIC intends to continue paying dividends on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. 
 Net bookings for the quarter were approximately $1 billion, which reflects a book-to-bill ratio of 0.8. SAIC’s estimated backlog of signed business orders at the end of the quarter was approximately $10 billion of which $1.9 billion was funded. 
 SAIC was awarded the following contracts during the quarter: 
 Notable Protect Awards (maintaining our existing contract base): 
 The U.S. Army Human Resources Command: SAIC was awarded a $108 million task order by the Army Human Resources Command to continue to develop, operate, and maintain more than 191 virtual applications that support soldiers from enlistment to retirement. Awarded under the Information Technology Enterprise Solutions - 2 Services (ITES-2S) contract vehicle, the single award task order has a one-year base period of performance, a one-year option, and a total contract value of approximately $108 million, if the option is exercised. 
 The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command (AMCOM): SAIC was awarded a $98 million task order by AMCOM to provide information technology (IT) support services. The Information Technology Support Services III task order has a one-year base period of performance, a one-year option, and an additional two-month option. The task order was awarded under the Information Technology Enterprise Solutions-2 contract vehicle. 
 The U.S. Navy: SAIC was awarded a $73 million task order by the U.S. Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) to provide architecture and systems engineering support services to the Office of the Chief Engineer (CHENG) (SPAWAR 5.0), the Fleet Readiness Directorate (FRD), and various C4ISR programs and offices. The single-award task order has a one-year base period of performance, and four one-year options. The task order was awarded under the SeaPort-e contracting vehicle. 
 Notable Expand Awards (selling new services & solutions to existing customers): 
 The U.S. Army and the General Services Administration (GSA): SAIC was awarded a $205 million task order by GSA, on behalf of the U.S. Army Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Project Management Office (PMO), to provide engineering, program management, and technical support services. Awarded under the GSA One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services (OASIS) contract vehicle, the task order has a one-year base period of performance and four one-year options. 
 NASA: SAIC will now manage NASA’s cloud-based web services under a new $58 million task order to provide the agency with various web support services. The task order was awarded under the NASA Enterprise Applications Service Technologies (EAST) 2 Master Agreement and will span roughly seven years, if all options are exercised. Under the task order, SAIC will support NASA with its existing agency-wide, cloud-based hosting capabilities.

26,"Burbank, CA, Dec. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Imaging3, Inc. (OTCQB:IGNG, “Imaging3” or the “Company”), a development stage company introducing disruptive technologies in the medical imaging industry, today provided an update on Company progress during 2018 and discussed goals for 2019. 
 John Hollister, Imaging3’s CEO, summarized key accomplishments: “Over the past year, the Company has completed a critical transition in leadership, recruiting a top-tier professional team, has established strategic partnering with leading regulatory, marketing and medical device R&D consulting organizations to support our objective of gaining 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA for our lead product, the Dominion SmartScan™ system, and has advanced constructive debt renegotiation with existing lenders. While encouraging progress has been made on these fronts, with the support of interim funding from existing and new investors, the Company has continued to develop investor discussions for its targeted $2.5M+ financing necessary to accelerate and complete the process of achieving a 510(k) submission to the FDA. Management remains optimistic and committed to timely completion of this crucial objective.” 
 Hollister explained: “One year ago, having completed several major post-bankruptcy recovery objectives under Dane Medley as CEO, Imaging3’s Board of Directors recruited me to join the Company and the Board, successfully completing the transition of the CEO role back into an instrument development, clearance and commercialization focus. My prior experiences brought nearly 30 years of diverse healthcare industry management to the Company, most recently as CEO of other public healthcare companies. My first priority was to continue the leadership transition, to recruit and build out a team and partners capable of guiding and executing the work phases required to bring the Dominion SmartScan™ system to market.” 
 Hollister highlighted critical evolution in the team: “Our first additions were announced in January, with the formation of our Scientific Advisory Board. Our first two members, Doctors Douglas P. Beal and Brooke Spencer, bring valuable different practice and research perspectives from the radiology community. Both are highly successful and respected leaders, and are frequent presenters at important medical and radiology meetings. In early March, we announced the appointment of Joe Biehl as Chief Financial Officer. Joe brought highly relevant experience to the Company from both smaller and larger companies and important hands-on financial leadership experience in rapidly expanding companies.” 
 Continuing on to Board evolution, Hollister noted: “In an effort to build a strong, independent board with relevant technical and commercial experience to guide and accelerate the Company through its next phase, we announced in March the addition of Jeffrey N. Peterson to the Board, and his appointment as Chairman. Mr. Peterson received BSChE and MSChE engineering degrees from MIT, and brought broad, global senior management experience from diverse businesses within GE, Abbott Laboratories and consulting roles. More recently, he continues to serve in the leadership of both public and private earlier stage life sciences companies, both as CEO and Chairman. He served for a dozen years on the Board of BayBio, a leading life sciences trade association, and chaired the entrepreneurially-focused BayBio Institute, while developing a tremendous network across the healthcare community. The following month, we added Dr. George Zdasiuk to the Board and to the Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Zdasiuk earned a PhD in applied physics from Stanford, and continued into a 30-year career at Varian Medical Systems, including 15 years as their Chief Technology Officer and VP of R&D. His deep scientific understanding spanning all medical imaging modalities is an invaluable resource for Imaging3 going forward.” 
 In May, the Company announced the resignations of Dane Medley and Xavier Aguilera from the President and CFO positions and from the Board. CEO Hollister acknowledged our thanks to them both for their service in managing Imaging3 through a very challenging period of restructuring and rebirth. 
 Turning to key new consulting partners, Mr. Hollister enumerated several: “In January, we engaged the highly-regarded technology, strategy and marketing consultants of Haltares Associates to help define and lead the Company through critical strategy planning. In March, we announced the selection of the Experien Group, a renowned medical device regulatory consultancy, to help lead our regulatory preparation and submission activities. The Experien Group have successfully assisted hundreds of companies like Imaging3 with their FDA submissions. Since the announcement, Experien has selected their team and we have initiated preliminary planning efforts. In November, we commenced work with a highly-experienced contract consulting team with particularly relevant radiology product R&D experience, on the evaluation and further instrument development planning around the Dominion SmartScan’s uniquely distinguishing algorithmic and software capabilities.” 
 Finally, reviewing financing progress, CEO Hollister reported: “In preparation for fund-raising and a step-wise progression towards a later uplist to a major stock exchange, the Company announced the successful completion of a 1:20 reverse split in April. This was an important step in our efforts to address the Company’s capital and debt structure as we improve our ability to attract new capital. In May, three of our note holders chose to complete the conversion of their debt investments entirely over into equity. In July, the Company received disappointing news, as the US District Court for the Southern District of New York granted summary judgment to two note holder plaintiffs in a case brought against the Company. We are working on an agreeable settlement, and have achieved excellent progress with all of our remaining note holders regarding fair settlement and/or conversion of the balances of their outstanding notes, upon arrangement of our targeted $2.5M+ equity financing.” 
 Hollister concluded: “The Company has raised approximately $700K since last December, used to fund essential operations both internally and through consulting activities noted above. The Company is diligently continuing efforts on multiple fronts to secure the targeted $2.5M+ equity investment bolus necessary to fund development, creation and submission of an appropriate 510(k) filing seeking FDA clearance for initial claims and marketing of the Dominion SmartScan™ system. We continue to anticipate that the 510(k) submission should follow approximately two quarters after completion of this key financing event. With 2019 at our doorstep, our prime focus remains fixed on securing this enabling financing as soon as possible. We are confident that we now have in place the leadership team needed to guide our execution of instrument development, clearance and commercialization plans, upon successful financing. We remain optimistic regarding securing acceptable terms for the targeted financing in the near future, and will issue updates accordingly. 
 About Imaging3, Inc. 
 Imaging3, Inc., founded in 1993, has developed a patented medical imaging technology, called the Dominion SmartScan™, that produces 3D X-ray images, effectively in real time. The SmartScan technology has the potential to allow healthcare professionals to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures more quickly and accurately, which may result in higher throughput for the clinicians and fewer safety risks for patients. Imaging3’s technology exposes patients to less harmful radiation than current equivalent imaging technologies such as CT scans. The company believes this will allow scans to be used in many settings where scanning is currently limited by concerns about radiation exposure. The technology also notably allows for reasonably convenient portability, easier installation and use-readiness, and a significantly reduced cost burden suitable for novel settings and for healthcare systems across varied global settings. Imaging3 plans to submit a 510(k) application to FDA during 2018 to gain marketing authorization for initial applications for the SmartScan technology. Visit the company’s website at http://www.imaging3.com for detailed information about the company’s technology.

28,"Apollo Endosurgery, Inc. (“Apollo”) (Nasdaq: APEN), a global leader in less invasive medical devices for gastrointestinal and bariatric procedures, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019. 
 Todd Newton, CEO of Apollo, commented, “Strong market momentum for OverStitch continued in the third quarter with 28% increase in sales. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in OverStitch sales. We remain enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead to continue this growth, driven by expansion of our user base and ongoing clinical investments that will continue to demonstrate the notable clinical benefits of our Endoscopy products.” 
 Consolidated Endoscopy product sales increased 12% as reported and 14% in constant currency. For the third quarter, 64% of Endoscopy product sales related to ESS. In the U.S., Endoscopy sales increased 30% to $4.8 million. 
 Worldwide, ESS product sales increased 28% as reported and 30% in constant currency. U.S. ESS product sales increased 48% to $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2019. Outside the US (“OUS”) ESS product sales increased 9% as reported and 12% in constant currency to $2.9 million. 
 Worldwide IGB sales decreased 9% as reported and 7% on a constant currency basis. U.S. IGB sales decreased $0.1 million, or 7%, to $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2019 while OUS IGB product sales decreased 9% as reported and 7% on a constant currency basis to $2.6 million. 
 The divestiture of our Surgical products in December of 2018 reduced total revenues in the third quarter of 2019 by $3.9 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. We divested the Surgical products in order to strengthen the organization’s focus on our Endoscopy products, which we believe have high growth potential. 
 Gross margin for the third quarter 2019 was 48%, compared to 55% for the third quarter 2018 as a result of a greater proportion of our overall product sales coming from our ESS products, which realize a lower gross margin than our other products. 
 Total operating expenses decreased $3.6 million to $12.3 million in the third quarter 2019, compared to the third quarter 2018. Research and development expense declined $1.5 million compared with the third quarter of 2018 as we neared completion in certain of our clinical studies. In addition, amortization expense is $1.3 million lower as a result of the reduction in our intangible assets after the recent divestiture of our Surgical products. 
 Net loss for the third quarter 2019 was $8.7 million compared to $9.8 million for the third quarter 2018. 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $36.0 million as of September 30, 2019. The Company raised proceeds of $20.0 million from the issuance of convertible debt in August 2019.

This supplemental measure of our performance is not required by, and is not determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 We believe the non-GAAP financial measure included herein is helpful in understanding our current financial performance. We use this supplemental non-GAAP financial measure internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business, and make operating decisions. We believe that making non-GAAP financial information available to investors, in addition to GAAP financial information, may facilitate more consistent comparisons between the company’s performance over time with the performance of other companies in the medical device industry, which may use similar financial measures to supplement their GAAP financial information. However, our non-GAAP financial measure is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP metric.

 Copyright Business Wire 2019.",2019-10-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Apollo Endosurgery, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2019 Results"
29,"Repro Med Systems, Inc. dba KORU Medical Systems (NASDAQ: KRMD) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the third quarter (“Q3 2019”) ended September 30, 2019. 
 “Our strong performance continued through Q3 2019,” said Don Pettigrew, President and CEO of KORU Medical Systems. “Net sales increased over 45% from Q3 2018, representing the third consecutive quarter of record net sales, and gross margin improved to over 66%. We continue to penetrate our primary disease state end markets, the growth of which we attribute to increasing awareness and diagnosis of PIDD and expanded therapeutic indications for CIDP. Our Freedom Syringe Infusion System is also being utilized in multiple clinical trials associated with the development of new subcutaneous therapies, which is an important component of our long-term growth strategy.” 
 Mr. Pettigrew concluded, “We also completed two significant corporate developments: the listing of our common stock on NASDAQ effective October 17 and our corporate re-branding to KORU Medical Systems. We believe that both developments reflect our continuing growth as a public company, and the new life and beginnings we provide to patients worldwide.” 
 Net sales rose 45.5% to $6.6 million in Q3 2019 from $4.5 million in Q3 2018. Growth was driven primarily by the Company’s continued success in expanding its presence in the Primary Immune Deficiency Disease (“PIDD”) and Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (“CIDP”) markets, as well as large orders from a domestic distributor, a new customer in Europe, and clinical trials. We cannot predict whether such large distributor orders or volume generally will continue in the future. 
 Gross profit in Q3 2019 rose to $4.4 million, or 66.2% of net sales, from $2.9 million, or 63.6% of net sales, in Q3 2018. Higher gross profit and gross margin were primarily driven by increased net sales and price increases. 
 Total operating expenses for Q3 2019 rose to $3.6 million from $2.4 million in Q3 2018. Selling, general & administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $2.4 million, or 36.9% of net sales, compared to $1.9 million, or 42.2% of net sales in Q3 2018. Litigation costs increased to $0.9 million from $0.3 million in Q3 2018. The Company received its second consecutive favorable judgment in the litigation with EMED Technologies Corp. on August 30, 2019. KORU Medical Systems has filed motions for reimbursement of court costs and attorneys’ fees subsequent to the receipt of both judgements. 
 Net income for Q3 2019 rose to $0.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, from net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in Q3 2018. 
 Q3 2019 Adjusted EBITDA rose to $2.1 million, or 31.5% of net sales, from Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 million, or 24.3% of net sales, in Q3 2018. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from net income: tax expense, depreciation and amortization, interest income, operating expenses associated with the company’s organizational changes prior to March 31, 2019, litigation costs, and stock option expense. 
 Cash and equivalents as of September 30, 2019 was $5.1 million. Cash flow of $1.4 million for the first nine months of 2019 included a $2.1 million increase in accounts receivable reflecting a change in payment terms by a large distributor of our products from net 30 days to net 60 days, as well as a $0.6 million increase in inventory to commensurate with sales growth. These increases were partially offset by $1.5 million in proceeds realized from the maturation of a Certificate of Deposit in Q2 2019 and $0.5 million associated with the exercise of warrants and options during the period. 
 This press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of “Adjusted EBITDA” that are not in accordance with, nor an alternate to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures is included in an attachment to this press release. 
 Management will host a conference call on Wednesday, November 6, 2019 at 9:00 am ET to discuss Q3 2019 results and business activities.

31,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov 8, 2018--WideOpenWest, Inc. (“WOW!” or the “Company”) (NYSE: WOW), a leading, fully integrated provider of residential and commercial high-speed data, video and telephony services to customers in the United States, today announced financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2018. 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2018, WOW! reported Total Revenue of $291.6 million, down $6.2 million, or 2.1%, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The Company reported third quarter 2018 Net Income of $30.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $106.7 million. 
 “I am so proud of our people and their accomplishments through the first three quarters of 2018,” said Teresa Elder, chief executive officer of WOW! “We achieved our third consecutive quarter of growth in organic HSD RGUs, combined with continued improvement across all customer metrics. These were the best third quarter RGU results in years. The investments we have made throughout the year are contributing to the overall results and are expected to continue to have a favorable impact going forward.” 
 “Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of $107 million continued the trend of sequential growth,” said Rich Fish, chief financial officer of WOW! “We continue to demonstrate the ability to grow customer relationships through record low churn levels, and the Company is positioned to achieve its Adjusted EBITDA goals for the year.” 
 (1) Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Operating Metrics,” “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures,” and “Unaudited Transaction Adjusted Condensed Consolidated Financial and Subscriber Information” in this Press Release for definitions and information related to Adjusted EBITDA and Transaction Adjusted financial information, reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the closest comparable GAAP measures and why our management thinks it is beneficial to present such non-GAAP measures. 
 On a reported basis, for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, Total Revenue was $291.6 million, an increase of 0.1% on a sequential basis compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2018, driven primarily by HSD RGU net additions. 
 Total subscription revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, was $267.3 million. Residential Subscription Revenue was $234.3 million, and Business Services Subscription totaled $33.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. Business Services Subscription Revenue, including the impact of Acquisitions and Dispositions, increased $3.9 million, or 13.4%, compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2017. 
 Other business services revenue totaled $6.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, down $3.0 million compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to decreased revenue generated by network construction activities associated with the Chicago network sale to a subsidiary of Verizon. 
 Other revenue totaled $17.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, down $9.0 million compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to the reclassification of franchise fees to residential video subscription revenue. 
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) totaled $152.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $37.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. 
 Net Income for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, was $30.5 million, compared to a Net loss of $(2.1) million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, was $0.37, compared to a loss per share of $(0.02) for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The year-over-year improvement in Net Income is attributable to a loss on extinguishment of debt in the third quarter of 2017 due to the redemption of 10.25% senior notes, the refinancing of the Company’s Term B Loan, and an income tax benefit due to a change in the valuation allowance. Adjusted Diluted Earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, was $0.40. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, was $106.7 million, an increase of $4.5 million, or 4.4%, on a sequential basis compared to Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.6% in the quarter ended September 30, 2018, an increase of over 150 basis points on a sequential basis. 
 WOW! reported Total Subscribers of 805,300 as of September 30, 2018. Total Subscribers increased by 5,200, or 0.6%, compared to June 30, 2018, which was the best third quarter result in the last four years. HSD RGUs totaled 755,100 as of September 30, 2018, representing an increase of 7,300, or 1.0%, compared to June 30, 2018, also the best third quarter result in the last four years. Excluding net additions from Edge-Outs, HSD RGU net additions were 4,500. 
 Video RGUs totaled 412,800 as of September 30, 2018, representing a decrease of 7,100 compared to June 30, 2018, which represents an improvement in the rate of video losses of 8,600, or 54.8%, as compared to the third quarter of 2017. 
 As of September 30, 2018, Edge-Out projects reached 122,200 homes passed as part of the Company’s Edge-Out growth efforts started in 2016.

The 2018 Edge-Out projects now include 2,300 customers on such nodes, which represents 16.2% penetration with an average of 87 days in active service.

Transaction Adjusted Capital Expenditures totaled $73.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, an increase of $7.9 million, or 12.0%, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2017.

Excluding Transaction Adjusted Strategic Capital Expenditures, Transaction Adjusted Capital Expenditures for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, totaled $57.0 million, which equates to 19.5% of Total Revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. 
 As of September 30, 2018, the total outstanding amount of long term debt and capital lease obligations was $2.322 billion, and cash and cash equivalents were $27.3 million. Total Net Leverage as of September 30, 2018, was 5.6x, on a LTM Transaction Adjusted EBITDA basis, and undrawn revolver capacity totaled $234.6 million.

 This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and we caution you not to place undue reliance on such statements. Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by the use of the words “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” “project,” “continue,” or the negative of these words, or other similar words or terms. The forward-looking statements included in this release are made as of the date hereof. We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, even if new information becomes available in the future or if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied in such statements will not be realized. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expected because of various risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including the wide range of competition we face in our business; competitors that are larger and possess more resources; dependence upon a business services strategy; conditions in the economy, including potentially uncertain economic conditions; our ability to secure new businesses as customers; demand for our bundled broadband communications services may be lower than we expect; our ability to respond to rapid technological change; increases in programming and retransmission costs; a decline in advertising revenues; the effects of regulatory changes in our business; our substantial level of indebtedness; certain covenants in our debt documents; programming exclusivity in favor of our competitors; inability to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support; strain on business and resources from future acquisitions, or the inability to identify suitable acquisitions; and other factors that are described from time to time in our filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. 
 We have included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release, including Revenue Including Acquisitions and Dispositions, Residential Subscription Revenue Including Acquisitions and Dispositions, Business Services Subscription Revenue Including Acquisitions and Dispositions, Adjusted EBITDA, Transaction Adjusted EBITDA, Transaction Adjusted Capital Expenditures, and Adjusted Diluted EPS. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). 
 We believe that these non-GAAP measures enhance an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with useful information for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures. We use these non-GAAP measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We believe these non-GAAP measures are measures commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. 
 Revenue Including Acquisitions and Dispositions, Residential Subscription Revenue Including Acquisitions and Dispositions, Business Services Subscription Revenue Including Acquisitions and Dispositions, and Transaction Adjusted Capital Expenditures give effect to certain acquisitions and divestitures made by WOW! and are included herein because they are key metrics used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are appropriate measures of operating performance because they are meaningful to investors by showing how certain acquisitions and divestitures might have affected our historical financial statements. The presentation of these measures is not made in accordance with GAAP and our use of these terms herein varies from the use of similar terms by other companies in our industry due to different methods of calculation and therefore are not necessarily comparable. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, capital expenditures or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is included herein because it is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance, and that the presentation of this measure enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. Transaction Adjusted EBITDA makes certain additional adjustments to the historical financial information that WOW! believes is meaningful to investors by showing how certain acquisitions and divestitures might have affected WOW!’s historical financial statements. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined by WOW! as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), impairment losses on intangibles and goodwill, management fees to related party, the write-up or write-off of any asset, loss on early extinguishment of debt, integration and restructuring expenses and all non-cash charges and expenses (including equity based compensation expense) and certain other income and expenses. Transaction Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA after giving effect to the impact of acquisitions and dispositions that were completed during the relevant periods as if they occurred at the beginning of the period presented. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Transaction Adjusted EBITDA is not made in accordance with GAAP and our use of the terms Adjusted EBITDA and Transaction Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA and Transaction Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows or liquidity. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Transaction Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools. For example, Adjusted EBITDA and Transaction Adjusted EBITDA: exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt. 
 Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share (EPS) is included herein because it is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. Adjusted Diluted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure that eliminates the effect of management fees to related party, loss on early extinguishment of debt, gain (loss) on sale of assets, impairment losses on intangibles and goodwill, non-recurring professional fees, M&A integration and restructuring expense, non-cash stock compensation, and other (income) and expenses. We then add or subtract an estimated incremental income tax effect applicable to those items. We believe that this measurement is useful to investors as an additional way to analyze the underlying trends in our business consistently across the periods presented. 
 The presentation of Adjusted Diluted EPS is not made in accordance with GAAP and our use of the term Adjusted Diluted EPS herein varies from the use of similar terms by other companies in our industry due to different methods of calculation and is not necessarily comparable. Adjusted Diluted EPS should not be considered as an alternative to Diluted EPS or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance. 
 See “ Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures ” and the accompanying tables below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation of Adjusted EPS to Diluted Earnings Per Share, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 In addition, we use the following subscriber information in this release: Homes Passed – We report homes passed as the number of serviceable addresses, such as single residence homes, apartments and condominium units, and businesses passed by our broadband network and listed in our database. Subscribers – Because we deliver multiple services to our customers, we report Total Subscribers as the number of subscribers who receive at least one of our HSD, Video or Telephony services, without regard to which or how many services they subscribe. We define each of the individual HSD subscribers, Video subscribers and Telephony subscribers as a revenue generating unit (“RGU”). 
 While we take appropriate steps to ensure subscriber information is presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, we periodically review our policies in light of the variability we may encounter across our different markets due to the nature and pricing of products and services and billing systems. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber information based on such reviews. 
 The following table provides unaudited reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures used herein for the periods indicated: 
 The SEC requires that pro forma financial information be presented in a registrant’s periodic filings when events occur for which disclosure would be material to investors, including significant business combinations or the disposition of a significant portion of the business. The significance of an acquired or disposed business is determined based on the “significant subsidiary” tests specified in Regulation S-X, Article 11, Rule 1-02(w). Although the Company has made certain acquisitions and divestitures, such transactions do not meet the “significant subsidiary” tests and, accordingly, the Company’s historical financial information as filed with the SEC does not contain pro forma financial information relating to those transactions. 
 Nevertheless, we make certain adjustments in this release to the historical financial and subscriber information of the Company as filed with the SEC (“Transaction Adjusted”) because we believe such information would be meaningful to investors by showing how such transactions might have affected the Company’s historical financial statements. The unaudited Transaction Adjusted financial and subscriber information in this release has been prepared giving effect to the divestiture of a portion of our Chicago Fiber Network in December 2017, and our divestiture of the Lawrence, Kansas, system in 2017, as if such transactions had been completed at the beginning of the respective periods presented. The unaudited Transaction Adjusted financial and subscriber information is for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what our results of operations, financial or subscriber information would have been if such transactions had occurred at any date, nor does such information purport to project the results of operations for any future period. 
 The unaudited Transaction Adjusted condensed consolidated financial and subscriber information in this release was prepared based on our books and records for the respective periods presented for the Lawrence, Kansas system and the portion of the Chicago Fiber Network that was divested. Such historical unaudited financial and subscriber information has been adjusted to give a Transaction Adjusted effect to events that are directly attributable to such transactions, factually supportable and expected to have a continuing impact on the results. The unaudited Transaction Adjusted financial information herein does not reflect non-recurring charges that have been incurred in connection with the transaction including legal fees, broker fees and accounting fees. 
 The following table provides an unaudited reconciliation of our residential subscription revenue to residential subscription revenue including Acquisitions and Dispositions, business services subscription revenue to business services subscription revenue including Acquisitions and Dispositions, Total Revenue to Total Revenue including Acquisitions and Dispositions, Adjusted EBITDA to Transaction Adjusted EBITDA and Capital Expenditures to Transaction Adjusted Capital Expenditures for the periods indicated:

35,"BONITA SPRINGS, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug 8, 2018--Herc Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HRI) (“Herc Holdings” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. Equipment rental revenue was $392.5 million and total revenues were $485.5 million in the second quarter of 2018, up from $350.8 million and $415.8 million, respectively, for the same period last year. The Company’s net results improved by $27.3 million to a net loss of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $27.6 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in the same period in 2017. 
 Equipment rental revenue increased 11.9%, average fleet at original equipment cost (OEC) increased 5.7% and overall pricing improved 2.9% in the second quarter of 2018 over the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14.4% to $152.2 million in the second quarter compared to $133.1 million in the comparable period in 2017. See page A-4 for a description of the items excluded in calculating adjusted EBITDA. 
 “Our focus on fleet, customer and local market diversification continued to drive strong organic rental revenue growth across North America in the second quarter,” said Larry Silber, president and chief executive officer. “We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in equipment rental revenue over the prior-year period, benefiting from improved volume, mix and price. 
 “We also completed the final separation of our financial information technology systems from Hertz at the end of July. The successful completion of this project means we no longer use any support services from our former parent and establishes our independence. With the final separation now behind us, our full attention and resources can be applied to operational improvements.” 
 Second Quarter Highlights Equipment rental revenue in the second quarter of 2018 increased 11.9%, or $41.7 million, to $392.5 million compared to $350.8 million in the prior-year quarter. The double-digit gain reflected strong growth in rental revenue from local accounts, and ProSolutions TM and ProContractor categories over the prior year. Total revenues increased 16.8% to $485.5 million in the second quarter compared to $415.8 million in 2017. The $69.7 million year-over-year improvement included an increase in sales of revenue earning equipment of $31.8 million. The Company benefited from a strong used equipment market as it continued to focus on improving equipment mix and reducing fleet age. Pricing increased 2.9% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, and represented the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2018 increased 14.4% to $152.2 million compared to $133.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. The increase reflected strong rental revenue growth in the quarter and improved pricing in the used equipment market. Dollar utilization of 35.4% in the second quarter of 2018 was up 140 basis points compared to the prior-year period, reflecting customer and fleet mix diversification and improved pricing. Direct operating expenses were $194.5 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $168.6 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to increased fleet and related expenses associated with higher equipment rental activity. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased $1.5 million to $77.3 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $78.8 million in the prior-year period. The year-over-year decline resulted primarily from the reduction of professional fees and costs related to the spin-off. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales personnel and related commissions to drive revenue growth. Interest expense in the second quarter of 2018 increased to $32.4 million compared to $31.6 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to an increase in average outstanding borrowings and a higher average interest rate on the revolving credit facility during the quarter, compared with the same period last year. The increase was partially offset by lower average outstanding borrowings on senior secured second priority notes during the second quarter of 2018 as compared to the prior-year period. Net results improved $27.3 million to a net loss of $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to a net loss of $27.6 million in the second quarter of 2017. Improved operating results and the prior-year’s pretax impairment of $29.3 million, due to the write-off of intangible assets related to the development of information technology systems, were the primary factors. 
 First Half Highlights Equipment rental revenue in the first half of 2018 increased 13.4%, or $90.2 million, to $761.6 million compared to $671.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The double-digit growth reflected strong growth in rental revenue from local accounts, and ProSolutions TM and ProContractor categories. Total revenues increased 13.9% to $916.8 million in the first half compared to $805.2 million in 2017. The $111.6 million year-over-year increase was aided by an increase in sales of revenue earning equipment of $24.7 million. The Company benefited from a strong used equipment market as it continued to focus on improving equipment mix and reducing fleet age. Pricing increased 2.8% in the first half of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2018 increased 23.4% to $284.9 million compared to $230.9 million in the first half of 2017. The increase was primarily due to strong rental revenue growth and improved pricing in the used equipment market. Direct operating expenses were $390.5 million in the first half of 2018 compared to $337.5 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to increased fleet and related expenses associated with higher equipment rental activity. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $8.1 million to $151.8 million in the first half of 2018 compared to $159.9 million in the prior-year period. The year-over-year decline resulted primarily from the reduction of professional fees and costs related to the spin-off. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales personnel and related commissions to drive revenue growth. Interest expense in the first half of 2018 declined $5.0 million to $64.4 million from $69.4 million in the prior-year period primarily due to the absence of costs incurred for the partial redemption of the Company’s senior secured second priority notes in March of 2017. Net results improved $56.4 million to a net loss of $10.4 million in the first half of 2018 compared to a net loss of $66.8 million in the comparable prior-year period. Improved operating results and a pretax impairment of $29.3 million in the prior-year second quarter, due to the write-off of intangible assets related to the development of new information technology systems, were the primary factors. 
 Capital Expenditures - Fleet The Company reported net fleet capital expenditures of $170.4 million for the first half of 2018. Gross fleet capital expenditures were $300.5 million, and disposals were $130.1 million. See page A-5 for the calculation of net fleet capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2018, the Company’s total fleet was approximately $3.87 billion at OEC, based on the American Rental Association guidelines. Average fleet at OEC increased 5.7% in the second quarter and 4.5% in the first half compared to the prior-year periods. Average fleet age declined to approximately 46 months as of June 30, 2018, compared with approximately 48 months in the prior-year period. 
 The Company affirmed its 2018 adjusted EBITDA and net fleet capital expenditures guidance. 
 The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial measures on a GAAP basis because certain items contained in the GAAP measures, which may be significant, cannot be reasonably estimated, such as restructuring and restructuring related charges, special tax items, gains and losses from asset sales and the ultimate outcome of pending litigation. 
 On July 12, 2018, for the redemption period from June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019, the Company redeemed $61 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.5% senior secured second priority notes due 2022 and $62.5 million of the 7.75% senior secured second priority notes due 2024 at a redemption price of 103% plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company had originally issued $610 million of the 2022 notes and $625 million of the 2024 notes in June 2016, and redeemed 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of each series of notes in both March 2017 and October 2017.

 This release contains statements, including those under “2018 Guidance,” that are not statements of historical fact, but instead are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. There are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those suggested by our forward-looking statements, including: Risks related to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and the restatement of financial statements previously issued by Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (in its form prior to the spin-off that effected the separation of the car rental business from us, “Hertz Holdings”), including that: we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that may adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, which may adversely affect investor and lender confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock and our ability to obtain future financing on acceptable terms, and we may identify additional material weaknesses; our efforts to design and implement an effective control environment may not be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses, or to prevent future material weaknesses; such material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected; we continue to expend significant costs and devote management time and attention and other resources to matters related to our internal control over financial reporting; our material weaknesses could expose us to additional risks that could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic plan and our financial position, results of operations and cash flows; any significant disruption or deficiency in the design of or implementing new information technology (“IT”) systems, including the financial system migrated from Hertz Rental Car Holding Company, Inc., which has been re-named Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (“New Hertz”), could materially adversely affect our ability to accurately maintain our books and records or otherwise operate our business; and Hertz Holdings’ restatement has been costly and has resulted in government investigations and other legal actions, and could result in government enforcement actions and private litigation that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows; Business risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity, including: the cyclicality of our business and its dependence on levels of capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers; a slowdown in economic conditions or adverse changes in the level of economic activity or other economic factors specific to our customers or their industries, in particular, contractors and industrial customers;our business is heavily reliant upon communications networks and centralized IT systems and the concentration of our systems creates or increases risks for us, including the risk of the misuse or theft of information we possess, including as a result of cyber security breaches or otherwise, which could harm our brand, reputation or competitive position and give rise to material liabilities;we may fail to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our IT networks;we may fail to respond adequately to changes in technology and customer demands;intense competition in the industry, including from our own suppliers, that may lead to downward pricing or an inability to increase prices;our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key management and other key personnel, and the ability of new employees to learn their new roles;we may have difficulty obtaining the resources that we need to operate, or our costs to do so could increase significantly;any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during our peak periods, given the seasonality of the business, especially in the construction industry;doing business in foreign countries exposes us to additional risks, including under laws and regulations that may conflict with U.S. laws and those under anticorruption, competition, economic sanctions and anti-boycott regulations;some or all of our deferred tax assets could expire if we experience an “ownership change” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code;changes in the legal and regulatory environment that affect our operations, including with respect to taxes, consumer rights, privacy, data security and employment matters, could disrupt our business and increase our expenses;an impairment of our goodwill or our indefinite lived intangible assets could have a material non-cash adverse impact;other operational risks such as: any decline in our relations with our key national account customers or the amount of equipment they rent from us; our equipment rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices we expect; maintenance and repair costs associated with our equipment rental fleet could materially adversely affect us; we may be unable to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property rights; we are exposed to a variety of claims and losses arising from our operations, and our insurance may not cover all or any portion of such claims; we may face issues with our union employees; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and the costs of complying with them, or any change to them impacting our markets, could materially adversely affect us; and strategic acquisitions could be difficult to identify and implement and could disrupt our business or change our business profile significantly; Risks related to the spin-off, which effected our separation from New Hertz, such as: the liabilities we have assumed and will share with New Hertz in connection with the spin-off could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; if there is a determination that any portion of the spin-off transaction is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including for reasons outside of our control, then we and our stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities, and we could also incur indemnification liability if we are determined to have caused the spin-off to become taxable; if New Hertz fails to pay its tax liabilities under the tax matters agreement or to perform its obligations under the separation and distribution agreement, we could incur significant tax and other liability; we have limited operating history as a stand-alone public company, and our historical financial information for periods prior to July 1, 2016 is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company, and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results; our ability to engage in financings, acquisitions and other strategic transactions using equity securities is limited due to the tax treatment of the spin-off; and the spin-off may be challenged by creditors as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance; Risks related to our substantial indebtedness, such as: our substantial level of indebtedness exposes us or makes us more vulnerable to a number of risks that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to compete; the secured nature of our indebtedness, which is secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets, could materially adversely affect our business and holders of our debt and equity; an increase in interest rates or in our borrowing margin would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability; and any additional debt we incur could further exacerbate these risks; Risks related to the securities market and ownership of our stock, including that: the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale or distribution of a large number of our shares or the perception that a sale or distribution could occur and these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future stock offerings; provisions of our governing documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control; and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly; and Other risks and uncertainties set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 under Item 1A “Risk Factors,” and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

39,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo is seeking nearly $74 million to replace decades-old computer technology used by the state for basic government functions like payroll and day-to-day accounting. 
 As part her 2020-21 budget proposal, Raimondo will ask lawmakers next week for $1.5 million for use next year, with the remaining $72.5 stretched out over seven years, the Providence Journal reported. 
 The computer system will allow the government to move away from heavily paper-based processes — including paper time sheets, which are still used across Rhode Island state government, said Department of Administration spokeswoman Brenna McCabe. 
 A new system will also reduce money spent on supplies like ink, reduce contractor work, payroll errors and terminate existing licensing fees, among other efficiencies, the agency said. 
 There’s dwindling institutional knowledge of the existing system, said the state’s chief information officer, Bijay Kumar. He added that an overhaul is needed to attract new workers with a system that mirrors what’s being learned in school and used in other employment sectors.",2020-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,Gov.

40,"NEW ORLEANS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb 1, 2019--ClaimsFiler, a FREE shareholder information service, reminds investors that they have until February 19, 2019 to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against NVIDIA Corporation (NasdaqGS: NVDA), if they purchased the Company’s shares between August 10, 2017 and November 15, 2018, inclusive (the “Class Period”).

 On November 15, 2018, the Company disclosed significant cuts to its Q4 revenue guidance, a decline of over 7% (compared to 17% growth expected by investors), due to inventory buildup of midrange GPUs (graphics processing units) caused by the rapid fade of the cryptocurrency mining market.

41,"LAKE MARY, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 10, 2019--CentralSquare, a leader in public sector software, will participate at the American Planning Association’s National Planning Conference (NPC), April 13-16, 2019, in San Francisco, CA. Presenting from booth 315, CentralSquare will showcase its Public Administration Enterprise and Pro software suites which include Community Development and Asset Management, among others. 
 “We’re pleased to have this opportunity to showcase CentralSquare solutions at this year’s National Planning Conference,” said Tom Amburgey, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Public Administration at CentralSquare. “As one of the first in the industry to offer our entire public administration suite in the cloud, we’re looking forward to connecting with NPC 2019 attendees and showing them how we can help their agencies keep pace with emerging technology while reducing costs, complexity and risk, which creates a significant and measurable impact for citizens.” 
 Trusted by communities across the United States and Canada, CentralSquare’s products deliver a consistent, fully scalable experience through smart integrations that span across multiple applications both in the cloud and onsite. For example, CentralSquare Public Administration Suite Pro – the world’s first end-to-end, cloud-based software for mid-tier government – delivers a unified, end-to-end enterprise suite for finance, asset management, community development, human capital management, municipal services, utilities and citizen engagement. With nearly three quarters of government workloads expected to be in the cloud by 2021, CentralSquare Finance Pro provides numerous benefits, including secure and resilient environments, ongoing and automated updates for leveraging the latest functionality and lower cost of ownership. For example, Tehama County, CA, an early adopter of Finance Pro, gains an extra level of security and reliability by eliminating the need to maintain potentially vulnerable servers onsite. Additionally, the county saves limited budget dollars with updates that previously were handled by outsourced IT services but are now delivered automatically on an ongoing basis. 
 CentralSquare Community Development, an integral component of Public Administration Suite Pro, smartly embeds analytics for unified business reporting and intelligence across multiple datasets in a single user interface. Additionally, a smart workflow engine automates projects completely through the flow of operations—from application to inspection to documentation to results. Powered with a GIS-centric database, the software enables users to visualize where activity is happening within the community by creating a project or permit directly from the map, which results in faster permit turnaround time—nearly 70 percent faster in some cases. 
 Also available as part of Public Administration Suite Pro, Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) software helps local governments understand which physical assets they own and need repair, how the assets are performing, how long they will last and how much it costs to replace or renew them. This helps agencies to understand the full scope and lifecycle of their assets so they avoid costly spikes in unplanned expenditures and build capital improvement plans for the long term. In two specific examples, for every dollar increase in preventive maintenance spending, the Department of Nebraska Roads is saving more than $50 in reactive maintenance, resulting in savings of more than $3.6 million on breakdown costs in one year. Similarly, in Volusia County, FL, operational efficiencies supported by EAM software have saved the county $30 million since 2008. 
 With their organizational procedures and citizen-service delivery transformed by these CentralSquare solutions, local governments have the tools they need to create safer, smarter communities. 
 CentralSquare encourages conference attendees to visit booth number 315 for personal demonstrations and to engage with company leadership and subject matter experts.

44,"eMoney Advisor (eMoney), a leading provider of technology solutions and services that help people talk about money, today expanded its Advisor Branded Marketing (ABM) tool with Automated Lead Generation campaigns, designed to help financial advisors be more efficient and successful in their search for new clients. 
 Financial advisors are in dire need of resources that streamline how to market their services in the digital age, especially to younger generations. Experts indicate $68 trillion in assets will be passed down from Baby Boomers to Gen X in the next two decades, opening up a new pool of clients that advisors must compete for. Further research by Investment News shows 74% of new clients are self-directed investors who are accustomed to using online information to reach decisions autonomously. 
 As advisors adapt strategies to match the needs of new client demographics and struggle to manually generate leads, data suggests tools like ABM can dramatically change outcomes. According to analysis of marketing automation software by Venture Beat, four in five users increase their leads and 77% report an increase in conversion. 
 With the new, simplified campaign workflow and automation in ABM, eMoney users will be able to schedule and launch ready-made targeted content campaigns to generate and nurture leads through digital channels in just a few clicks. The ABM release includes: 
 - A redesigned Advisor Branded Marketing dashboard that serves as a marketing command center, allowing users to quickly see featured content, easily navigate to favorited content, or launch and manage automated campaigns. 
 - A library of targeted campaigns to reach niche markets. 
 - Kitted campaigns so that advisors have everything they need without having to worry about sourcing or creating content. 
 - Fully automated workflows that eliminate the manual task of following up with new contacts to nurture and convert them.

46,"Sen. George Allen was unanimously elected chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee yesterday by GOP senators searching for a fresh face to defend their new majority and to reach out to donors in a stingier, post-campaign-finance-reform world. 
 Allen's promotion to the Senate GOP's fundraiser in chief, just two years into his first term, reflected the rapid rise in the party of the former Virginia governor and one-term House member from Charlottesville. 
 Although Allen, 50, made his name as a fierce partisan early in his career, he has impressed Senate colleagues by his willingness to stake out strong ideological stands, particularly on tax and foreign policy issues, with a non-threatening, sunny manner that has played well on the national GOP fundraising circuit. 
 He has cultivated a donor base in Virginia, in the technology industry and around friends of his famous namesake father, the longtime National Football League coach who was inducted this year into the NFL Hall of Fame. 
 The new post gives Allen access to the Republican Party's national contributors and positions him to dispense help and to forge alliances among senators well before his own 2006 reelection campaign. 
 The incoming Senate majority leader, Trent Lott (R-Miss.), introducing Allen yesterday as one of seven Senate GOP leaders elected without opposition, said: ""We think we have found the right person for the job. He is young and developing. . . . He's willing to take positions. He's willing to lead."" 
 ""It has played in Peoria, the Allen personable approach,"" said Robbie Aiken, vice president of federal affairs for the Arizona energy firm Pinnacle West Capital Corp., who supported Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) during his 2000 presidential campaign and raised $60,000 for Allen. 
 ""That's what makes the difference -- he comes off so sincere,"" said Aiken, who called Allen ""disarmingly smart"" and added, ""He doesn't mind playing a little bit aw-shucks and being folksy, but he's dead serious on the issues."" 
 Allen was Senate co-chairman and then chairman of the President's Dinner, the GOP's main House-Senate fundraising event with the White House, last year and this year. Allen was credited with raising $3 million. 
 Allen took over the political action committee of the late senator Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), the Good Government for America PAC, raising and donating about $250,000 to Senate Republicans. Allen was named head of the Senate GOP's technology task force and fought sales taxes on Internet transactions. 
 As chairman, Allen, who now lives in Alexandria, will direct GOP candidate recruitment and fundraising for 2004. 
 The job just became more challenging. Starting last week, the national political parties were legally barred from raising and spending soft money contributions -- large donations from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals, which helped boost the NRSC total to $109 million as of October for the 2002 election. 
 The McCain-Feingold legislation limits contributions to $2,000 per individual per election, so a lot more donors will have to be contacted. Allen's task will be a daunting one: Come close to the 2002 total while competing for funds with President Bush's reelection effort. 
 Allen also will have to redefine the role of the party committee, which has lavished most of its money on TV ads. 
 For example, the NRSC spent $1.8 million on ads in Georgia 10 days before Election Day to defeat Sen. Max Cleland (D) and nearly outspent Missouri Sen.-elect Jim Talent (R) with $7 million of help on television. 
 Republicans are forming a new soft money issue advocacy entity that under tax law will not have to disclose who gives money or how the money is spent. 
 ""We need to be more creative, more energetic and redouble or triple our efforts,"" said Allen, who said Republicans are consulting with fundraising lawyers and with chairmen who ran the NRSC before soft money use exploded, naming Ted Stevens (Alaska), Don Nickles (Okla.) and departing Sen. Phil Gramm (Tex.). 
 Allen has built a following among the Republican leadership's influential K Street backers. 
 Lisa Nelson, former aide to Newt Gingrich and lobbyist for AOL Time Warner, which gave $14,000 to Allen, said: ""It's been clear that Senator Allen can motivate and grow the party. We're thrilled to have him move into a leadership position that will help him broaden the party and elect his type of senator."" 
 Major local donors to Allen include Walter M. Curt, president of Shenandoah Electronic Intelligence of Harrisonburg, and Thomas L. Blair, owner of Federal Medical Inc., a Bethesda health care company. Curt gave $100,000 and Blair gave $50,000 to Allen's state political committees before they became inactive after last week's elections.",2002-11-14T00:00:00.000Z,GOP Picks Allen as Fundraiser
